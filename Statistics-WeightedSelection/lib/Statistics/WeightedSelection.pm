=head1 NAME

C<Statistics::WeightedSelection> - Select a random object according to its weight.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::WeightedSelection;

    my $w = Statistics::WeightedSelection->new();

    # add some objects
    $w->add(
        object => 'string',
        weight => 4,
    );
    $w->add(
        object => {p => 1, q => 2},
        weight => 1,
    );
    $w->add(
        object => $any_scalar,
        weight => 7.5,
    );

    # get a random one based upon the individual weight relative to the
    #   combined weight and remove it from the pool for future selection
    #
    #   4 / 12.5 * 100 percent of the time, you'll get 'string'
    #   1 / 12.5 * 100 percent of the time, you'll get {p => 1, q => 2}
    # 7.5 / 12.5 * 100 percent of the time, you'll get $any_scalar
    my $object = $w->get();

    # because the last one was removed, the remaining objects are the new
    #   pool for calculating weights and probabilities
    my $another_object = $w->get();

    # get the number of objects remaining
    my $remaining_object_count = $w->count();

    # when constructed using with_replacement and a true value, probababilities
    #   of being selected will remain constant, as after an item is selected,
    #   it is not removed from the pool.
    my $wr = Statistics::WeightedSelection->new(with_replacement => 1);
    #...
    #...
    my $replaced_object = $wr->get();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Statistics::WeightedSelection> object is intended to hold unordered objects
(at least logically from the caller's perspective) that each have a corresponding
weight.  The objects can be any perl scalar or object, and the weights can be any
positive integer or floating number.

At any time, an object can be retrieved from the pool.  The probability of
any object being selected corresponds to its weight divided by the combined
weight of all the objects currently in the container.

Objects that are no longer desired to be in the pool can be removed, and
an id can be assigned to any of the items to ease in this later removal.

=head1 CAVEATS

An intentional design decision was to use a simple blessed hash to represent
the internals of the object, with no direct accessors, which should not
be necessary for users of the object.  The C<dump()> method is there as a way
to see them, but individual items should not be directly manipulated, and if
they are, there's no guarantee of your success.

Adding and manual deletion should be done through the appropriate methods,
C<add()> and C<remove()>, respectively.

I partially did this for speed reasons, and partially to protect people from
accidental mishaps.  Perhaps I could be persuaded to do so with a sufficiently
reasonable argument.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR - new()

To create a new cache object, call C<Statistics::WeightedSelection-E<gt>new>.
It takes the optional arguments listed below.

=over

=item C<with_replacement> (optional)

This single configuration, when true, will not remove the object selected
from the pool after a call to C<get()>;

    # replace the object selected with the same object, i.e. don't remove it.
    my $w = Statistics::WeightedSelection->new(with_replacement => 1);

=back

=head2 add()

This method is used to add an object and weight to the objects for possible
future selection.  Two required and one optional arg are described below.

=over

=item C<object> (required)

The object.  Any scalar will do: string, arrayref, hashref, blessed scalar
or otherwise.

=item C<weight> (required)

The weight.  Integer or float/decimal.  Must be greater than 0.  This arbitrary
number when divided by the total combined weights of the object is the probability
that it will be selected on the next call to C<get()>.

=item C<id> (optional)

This is an id that can be used to C<remove()> items later, if desired.  It is not
required, and the value, if not passed, will default to a serialized version
of the object passed (see above).

=back

=head2 get()

Selects an object from the bucket / pool / container randomly, with probabilities
of being picked for each item equal to its weight divided by the combined weights.

By default, the object is removed without replacement.  A special method exists,
C<replace_object>, that will determine if the object will be removed or replaced.

If any of the following happened, the object will be replaced, i.e.  not removed.

Returns the randomly selected object.

=over

=item C<with_replacement> was passed to the constructor with a truthy value

This condition is only true if the C<with_replacement()> method was not subsequently
called to set to a possible different value.

=item C<replace_object> has been overridden by a subclass of this module

and the override returns true.

=item The most recent call to C<with_replacement()> included a truthy value.

=back

Takes no arguments.

=head2 dump()

Returns an arrayref of hashrefs, which represents most of the internals of the
selection pool.  Each hashref in the arrayref will look something like this:

    # {object => 'myscalar', weight => 1, id => 'myscalar'}

Of all the methods, this is the most likely to change in the future, but I will
attempt to keep it similar.

It should be noted that there is no consolidation of like objects.  They will
be returned exactly as they were added, even if in duplicate.

=head2 remove()

Items that were previously added using C<add()> can be removed from future selection.
Either objects that are equivalent (not necessarily a ref to the same object in the
container, but one that after serialization is equivalent), or ones that match an id
(which was an optional arg for C<add()>) will all be removed.

Returns the removed scalars.

=head2 clear()

Removes all items from the selection pool.  A call to C<get()> immediately afterward
will return nothing.

=head2 count()

The current count of objects that are in the selection pool.  It should be noted that
sometimes, the same scalar might have been added multiple times with calls to C<add()>, and
that those separate instances are all counted separately.

=head2 replace_object()

Returns whether or not a future call to C<get()> will replace the object (i.e. not remove
it).  If true, the object will not be removed.  If false, the object will be removed.

The default behavior, if nothing was passed to the constructor, is to have this return false.

In a subclass, this method could be overwritten for behavior that doesn't always or never
replace the object after a call to C<get()>.  An alternative is to set the value for
subsequent selections using C<with_replacement()>.

=head2 with_replacement()

Takes one argument, which must be defined (I didn't think it to be good form to default
a call with zero args to C<with_replacement()> to be falsey, as it might almost appear
to be desired at first read).  This sets whether or not an object will be removed from
the pool after selection.  If this is true, it will remain after a call to C<get()>, and
if false, it will not.  This overrides the setting, if any, that was passed to the
constructor, and will affect future calls to C<replace_object()>, assuming the object is
not a subclass that overrides that method.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The ideas encapsulated in this module were created while I was working at Rent.com, a
RentPath company.  Rent.com has supported me the whole way in releasing this module, and
they have fostered an openness in not only utilizing open community tools, but contributing
to them, as well.

I'd also like to thank an organization and a few individuals for their contributions:

=over

=item YAPC 2014 in Orlando, Florida

The conference that finally pushed me to finish this module and make it available.

=item Ripta Pasay

My manager (and brilliant developer) at Rent, who helped ask the appropriate management
at our company about releasing this module without specific, formal policies.  He also
helped me vet the algorithm and test for problems in randomness on initial and subsequent
selections.

=item Aran Deltac

Former Rent.com employee who helped by allowing me to bounce ideas for names and interface
of this module, and also to help me search for modules that might have already been written
to accomplish a similar purpose.

=item Steve Nolte

Head hauncho of Milwaukee PM who helped steer me in the direction of how to package and
manage this module for release.

=item Steven Lembark

For discussing namespaces and name ideas with a total stranger.  He really is a testament
to how helpful people in the Perl community can be.

=item Sawyer X

More discussion of namespaces, and helping to guide me in to whom to talk about such things
for further ideas.

=item Adam Dutko

For giving a talk at YAPC to discuss issues about making a module and getting it ready for
release on CPAN.
